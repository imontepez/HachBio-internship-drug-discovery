__Pharmacophore Modelling: Drug Discovery Technique__
**********

Pharmacophore implies a compound's functional or structural capacity with a specific feature to a biological target **\[4].** Pharmacophore modelling is a crucial computational technique in drug discovery for developing anticancer agents by identifying the molecule's essential features that guarantee optimal interactions with a specific biological target such as a protein or enzyme. The model can be a ligand-based or structure-based approach with Virtual Screening to identify compounds that match as potential therapeutic agents. The choice of model is dependent on data availability and quality, computational resources and the intended use of the generated model.  Its important features are; Hydrogen Bond Acceptor and Donor, Hydrophobic Areas, positively and negatively ionizable groups, aromatic groups and metal coordinating areas **[5]**.
*************

__Ligand-based pharmacophore Modelling__  uses only ligand structures derived from structures of known active compounds **[1, 8]**. A 3D ligand-based pharmacophore model searches for pharmacophores that match only the active compounds without the inactive ones and is used when no structural information on the macromolecular target is available **\[9]**. The model generating tools include; LigandScout, Discovery Studio, MOE, PHASE, PharmaGist, USRCAT, etc. This model was used to identify flavonoids with potential anti-Hepatitis B virus activities **[10]**.
********

__Structure-based pharmacophore__ is based on a receptor-ligand complex interaction and its orientation **[2]** as a strategy for combating cancer growth by identifying potential inhibitors for specific target drugs **[1]**. This model can be generated with Discovery Studio or LigandScout. Discovery Studio is based on four types of interaction (Aliphatic, aromatic, lipophilic, HB-acceptor and donor) of the functional group of the ligand and the active site of a protein on the interaction map, While in LigandScout, all chemical features involved in protein-ligand interaction are considered. The structure-based model has been used to discover CCR5 inhibitor **(NSC13165)** as cancer therapy for HIV-1 with less toxicity **[5]**.
***********

__Virtual Screening__  ___(in silico)___ is a computational technique used in drug discovery to search existing virtual libraries of bioactive compounds to identify receptors or enzymes with potential drug targets. It filters and validates the pharmacophore model by providing a focused search criterion based on known active compounds **[10, 11, 12]**.
*********

__Conclusion___    pharmacophore model is a computational technique in a 3D pattern with a ligand-based or structure-based approach, validated using virtual screening for the production of multi-target drugs, and the design for non-resistance medicines with improved binding affinity **[2, 7]**. Also used for identifying lead compounds with known toxicity profiles and predicting their side effects **[6]**.
